## Safari 8

It works perfectly:

0. Enters fullscreen
0. Exits fullscreen

## Firefox 35

Buggy, annoying but working:

0. Enters fullscreen (on Codepen.io)
0. Enters fullscreen (YouTube.com)
0. Third click: Exits fullscreen

## Chrome 40

Buggy, broken:

0. Enters fullscreen (on Codepen.io)
0. Does nothing
0. Third click: Exits fullscreen but the video fills the iframe, effectively breaking the site. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/CHibfEN.png" target="_blank">Screenshot</a>


## Mobile browsers

This is the default behavior on iPhone, but it cannot work anywhere else (Android, iPad) since 

* to `play()` a video or to `requestFullScreen()` you need a user tap **in the same document** (read: not across the iframe)

This means that

* you can't call `requestFullScreen()` when the video emits the event `onplay`
* you can't trigger `play()` via YouTube API (it would cross the frame) **and** call `requestFullScreen()` in the same tap

So with one tap **either** you play the video **or** get it fullscreen; you'll always need two separate taps if you use YouTube.
